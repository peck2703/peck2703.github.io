					General Skills
				</h3>
				<br>
					<button class="skill-written skills collapsible">Communication: Written</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Years of writing professional memos and security reports reinforced the skills needed to keep all written communication in a professional manner.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I am unfamiliar with some rarely used or aware of unknown forms of written communication.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-verbal skills collapsible">Communication: Verbal</button>
					<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Years of working in corporate environments taught me to think before I say anything that might come across as unprofessional.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I have an infrequent speech impediment that prevents me from saying certain words or pronouncing consonant sounds.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-agile-build skills collapsible">Agile: Build Master</button>
					<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Using Git in command-line and the GitHub Desktop app was easier to transition with my previous experience, and was much smoother than when working with the Git Shell and GUI. 
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: It took me some trial and error to learn about pull requests and working with different branches. Eventually, it took some extra lessons to become familiar with the new concepts.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-agile-programmer skills collapsible">Agile: Lead Programmer</button>
					<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: My years of programming helped me come up with new and interesting ideas on how to overcome various obstacles.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I am not 100% confident in my leadership skills, but some members in my team do look up to me for help.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-agile-owner skills collapsible">Agile: Product Owner</button>
					<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: I am able to make quick and final decisions regarding tasks in the backlog, and I am able to keep the team on task and following my vision for the project.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I lack the creativity "gene" when designing a game, so whenever I have an idea, I have to hold onto it, so I can mold it. 
							</p>
						</div><br>
				<hr>
				<h3 class="text-spacing-left">
					Languages
				</h3>
				<br>
					<button class="skill-csharp skills collapsible">C#</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Being my first language, I still prefer to use this language when giving the option. I started off working in Windows Forms and then practiced using Windows Console.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: For a school assignment, we had to use WPF forms, and it was difficult to adjust to the new format. I also lack confidence in working with hardware, because I don't know how to do firmware.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-java skills collapsible">Java</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Java is very similar to C# in many ways, so transitioning to Java was simple for me.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: My experience was limited to console applications, so I am unfamiliar with Java Web or making windows. I also do not care much for the Netbeans IDE.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-cplusplus skills collapsible">C++</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: While not similar to C# in any fashion, the logic that is applied to Java or C# can also be applied to this language.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I was thrown into a large existing code base for my first project (See Raven on the Portfolio page), so the learning curve was steep. It's unfortunate that all Unreal C++ libraries are extensive, so it takes me some time to sift through.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-html skills collapsible">HTML</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: The W3 Schools website is a wonderful teacher, allowing me to experiment with various tags and attributes. My formal education in HTML was only at a beginner level, so I filled the rest with the W3 Schools.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I am too detail-oriented, and I often leave spaces between tags and other text, which leads to unpredictable spacing in browsers.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-css skills collapsible">CSS</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Spacing doesn't matter in CSS, so my detail oriented nature allows me to organize my tags and their attributes for easier reading.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I have trouble setting up media screens for responsive pages.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-c skills collapsible">C</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Familiarity with C++ even though C++ is a superset, does help me understand some aspects of C.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I have troubles with the structure, as it differs greatly with my other languages.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-obj-c skills collapsible">Obj-C</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: I have experience with setting up a GUI in a drag-and-drop environment, even for Apple.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: The language and its structure is almost alien-like to me.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
				<hr>
				<h3 class="text-spacing-left">
					Game Engines
				</h3>
				<br>
					<button class="skill-unreal-bp skills collapsible">Unreal Engine 4: Blueprints</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Visual programming with blueprints was my first experience with Unreal, and while it was not a pleasant experience at first, I got the hang of which nodes I would need to use for each task, and then compared it with my knowledge of logic.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: There are a lot of nodes that I have yet to learn, and I have just begun to work in the Construction Scripts page in blueprints.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-unity3d skills collapsible">Unity3D</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Working with C# was always my preferred language, and even though JavaScript was used in most tutorials, I was able to understand the structure of the game classes and the prefabricated methods.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: I have issues when working with animations, and their controllers, so I try to avoid those at all cost. It is also the reason that I now prefer Unreal over Unity3D.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br>
					<button class="skill-unreal-cplusplus skills collapsible">Unreal Engine 4: C++</button>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								Strengths: Working with blueprints almost exclusively, I have noticed that blueprints resemble most of the methods in C++, so I am able to make small changes.
								<br><br>
								Weaknesses: Focusing solely on a C++ project is very overwhelming for me, so converting from blueprints may take more time, but will help further my understanding.
