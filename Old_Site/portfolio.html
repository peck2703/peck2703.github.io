We chose to do a Mini-map, replication of our viruses, and teleportation devices. We were a team of 7 from the start, but we had a lack of work performed by most of our members, so the bulk of our work was done by three of us. This did put stress on our scope and our quality of work, as we were missing models, and some of our blueprints were still buggy.</span>

The only thing lacking from this model is a proper UV map, as that concept still eludes me, but before my personal game project is complete, I will figure out a way to complete this UV map.</span>
